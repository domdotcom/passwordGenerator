#Password Generator

This is an exercise in Javascript. The Password Generator has a minumum is 8 characters and maxiumum of 128. It can include or exclude lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols. It is also responsive when viewed on screen smaller than 500px.

To create the random password I utilzed charCodes that are built into Javascript rather than creating several arrays of lowercase and uppercase letters, number and symbols.

I also built in inputs of checkboxes and a number input into the html rather than utilzing alerts for a cleaner, more seamless user experience, where the client can check their desired criteria from the onset and simply hit generate password once. 

Below are images of the generator in mobile view, in its default state and having generated a random password.
